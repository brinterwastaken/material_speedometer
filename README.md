# VelocityView

VelocityView, a simple, powerful, Material3 themed speedometer app.
## Note: 
- The application is still in BETA, and bugs can be expected.
- Speed accuracy depends on multiple factors, and the application is only meant to give an idea of the speed. It is not a scientific measurement application.
